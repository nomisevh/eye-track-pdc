# Multivariate Time-Series Classification for Parkinsonâ€™s Diagnosis

This repository hosts the code used to produce the results presented in our paper titled "Deep Learning Models Accurately Classify Parkinson's Disease from Eye-Tracking Fixation Data", published in Nature Scientific Reports.

## Development Setup <a href="#setup"></a>

### Setting up environment

#### conda

To set up using conda, run the following:

```bash
cd <project_root>
conda env create -f conda/[OS].yaml
```

To update an existing environment to use the latest dependencies, run the following:

```bash
cd <project_root>
conda activate eyetrackpdc
conda env update --file conda/[OS].yaml --prune`
```

### Datasets

We use a private dataset from the Karolinska Institute for our experiments. For details, see our paper.
For information regarding access to the data, refer to the section "Data Availability" in our paper.

### Logging

Logging is done via Neptune. For privacy reasons the neptune config is not tracked in version control. In order to use
with neptune, create a config on the form:

```yaml
project: <str>
api_key: <str>
capture_hardware_metrics: True
# async (default), offline, debug
mode: async
```

## How To Run <a href="#run"></a>

After making sure that the environment is set up and the data is in the `data/ki` directory, you can
run the various experiments by their respective entrypoints in the `src/entrypoints` directory.

### Experiments

- Classification with ROCKET and classic ML classifiers `src/entrypoints/rocket.py`
- Classification with InceptionTime `src/entrypoints/inception.py`
- And more...
