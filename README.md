## Development Setup <a href="#setup"></a>

### Setting up environment

#### conda

To set up using conda, run the following:

```bash
cd <project_root>
conda env create -f conda/[os].yaml
```

To update an existing environment to use the latest dependencies, run the following:

```bash
cd <project_root>
conda activate eyetrackpdc
conda env update --file conda/[OS].yaml --prune`
```

### Datasets

We use a private dataset from the Karolinska Institute for our experiments. For details, see our paper **todo**.
For access to the data, contact the authors.

### Logging

Logging is done via Neptune. For privacy reasons the neptune config is not tracked in version control. In order to use
with neptune, create a config on the form:

```yaml
project: <str>
api_key: <str>
capture_hardware_metrics: True
# async (default), offline, debug
mode: async
```

## How To Run <a href="#run"></a>

After making sure that the developmental environment is set up and the data is in the `data/ki` directory, you can
run the various experiments by their respective entrypoints in the `src/entrypoints` directory.

### Experiments

- Classify time series segments with ROCKET and classic ML
  classifiers `src/entrypoints/rocket_segment_classification.py`
- Classify time series segments with InceptionTime and classic ML
  classifiers `src/entrypoints/inception_segment_classification.py`
- &lt;we will update this list with new experiments&gt;
